Chiron is a framework-agnostic subscription management framework for TypeScript. At its core, Chiron features a flexible plugin architecture (inspired by [better-auth](https://better-auth.com)) that enables seamless integration with a wide range of payment providers including Lemon Squeezy, Polar.sh, Google Play, App Store, and many others.

## Why Chiron?

Integrating subscriptions into applications can be a challenging process. The primary issue is that subscription data is typically stored on the payment provider's side. To access and use this data, you must synchronize it between your application and the provider via APIs and webhooks. This process is not only time-consuming but also stressful, often leading to hours of debugging and troubleshooting. Chiron solves this problem by abstracting the repetitive synchronization process and providing a unified interface for managing subscriptions.
